**Post-quantum maturity:** Level 0 of 4 — no post-quantum cryptography. **Next step:** Inventory where classical public-key cryptography protects long-lived data and keys, and choose the first migration: usually a hybrid TLS key exchange and wrapped keys.

**Findings:** Critical 0 · High 0 · Medium 5 · Low 0 · Info 1

**Quantum timeline (Mosca: x + y − z):** Signatures 10 + 5 − 8 = 7 → too late

Full report signature (report.sig.json): Ed25519 key, SHA-256 fingerprint `5b3cf9c9bd0fa54447e2b5dfa7a6bab569bd0c666fa46949599e5c348d17083e`. bundle.sig.json lists the SHA-256 of every file in this bundle and is signed too; verify-bundle checks it offline.

Preliminary findings need confirmation in the code; the full report gives the evidence, the limits of each check and how to re-test.
