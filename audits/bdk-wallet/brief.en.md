**Post-quantum maturity:** Level 0 of 4 — no post-quantum cryptography. **Next step:** Inventory where classical public-key cryptography protects long-lived data and keys, and choose the first migration: usually a hybrid TLS key exchange and wrapped keys.

**Findings:** Critical 0 · High 0 · Medium 3 · Low 0 · Info 0

**Quantum timeline (Mosca: x + y − z):** Signatures 10 + 5 − 8 = 7 → too late

## What matters most

1. **Medium** · Quantum-vulnerable ECDSA: transaction and message signing (5 file(s)) (QSI-2026-17720) · *preliminary*\
   What to do: Follow each chain's post-quantum roadmap, avoid public-key reuse, and keep signers ready to add post-quantum signature schemes as chains…
2. **Medium** · Quantum-vulnerable Schnorr (BIP-340): transaction and message signing (4 file(s)) (QSI-2026-17721) · *preliminary*\
   What to do: Follow each chain's post-quantum roadmap, avoid public-key reuse, and keep signers ready to add post-quantum signature schemes as chains…
3. **Medium** · Quantum-vulnerable ECDSA: role not determined (1 file(s)) (QSI-2026-17719) · *preliminary*\
   What to do: Classify each usage, record data lifetimes, and plan migration to ML-DSA (FIPS 204) or SLH-DSA (FIPS 205), in a hybrid/composite form…

Full report signature (report.sig.json): Ed25519 key, SHA-256 fingerprint `5b3cf9c9bd0fa54447e2b5dfa7a6bab569bd0c666fa46949599e5c348d17083e`. bundle.sig.json lists the SHA-256 of every file in this bundle and is signed too; verify-bundle checks it offline.

Preliminary findings need confirmation in the code; the full report gives the evidence, the limits of each check and how to re-test.
